# cloudant-test

## Objective
To create a sample application to play with multiple technologies. At the moment this includes:

* IBM BlueMix
* IBM Cloudant (Apache CouchDB for Development)
* Node / Express
* Grunt
* d3.js
* flot
* Google Maps
* twitter streams


## Usage
To start the App you have to run node app.js
This will connect to couchDB / cloudant based on the environment variables. If you're deploying to Bluemix, don't forget to modify your `manifest.yml` file
You will have to manually create the design document once the database twitter was created, to do so you have to use the `/Cloudant/design1.json`
